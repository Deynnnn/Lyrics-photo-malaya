        Saw you singing your song the other day
        It's been a long time since your eyes lit up that way
        I felt the guilt build up as I looked back how things went wrong
        Did I have to sweep in and scar you?
        Five years, we shared the bittersweetness of our youth
        Then we broke up, because sometimes it is the best thing to do
        Did it ever cross your mind that maybe you hurt me too?
        But I'm not taking it against you
        Since the beginning, I never wanted anything
        But to see you reach your dreams, I knew that you just wanted me
        But I had dreams of my own, and I just couldn't let them go
        So, I apologize for coming into your life
        Just to break your heart to pieces, and then leave you in the night
        And I tried my best to stay by your side
        But who knew the rolling seasons would reveal that sometimes
        We aren't meant to be the one?
        So, goodbye to the ones we once loved
        When things got heavy, and you expected more from me
        I tried to be there to take away your tears
        But I didn't notice that I was chipping away
        At pieces of myself 'til there was nothing left to give
        I didn't even want to live
        But I apologize for coming into your life
        Just to break your heart to pieces, and then leave you in the night
        And I tried my best to stay by your side
        But who knew the rolling seasons would reveal that sometimes
        We aren't meant to be the one?
        So, goodbye to the ones we once loved
        I realized it wasn't anyone's fault at all
        It's just that I wasn't built to build you up when you fall
        Maybe we were meant to be a lesson to each other
        But I wish you well, and I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
        Oh, I apologize for coming into your life
        Just to break your heart to pieces, and then leave you in the night
        And I tried my best to stay by your side
        But who knew the rolling seasons would reveal that sometimes
        We aren't meant to be the one?
        So, goodbye to the ones, I wasn't meant to be the one
        So, goodbye to the one I once lovedSaw you singing your song the other day

        Did it ever cross your mind that maybe you hurt me too?
        But I'm not taking it against you
        Since the beginning, I never wanted anything
        But to see you reach your dreams, I knew that you just wanted me
        But I had dreams of my own, and I just couldn't let them go
        So, I apologize for coming into your life
        Just to break your heart to pieces, and then leave you in the night
        And I tried my best to stay by your side
        But who knew the rolling seasons would reveal that sometimes
        We aren't meant to be the one?
        So, goodbye to the ones we once loved
        When things got heavy, and you expected more from me
        I tried to be there to take away your tears
        But I didn't notice that I was chipping away
        At pieces of myself 'til there was nothing left to give
        I didn't even want to live
        But I apologize for coming into your life
        Just to break your heart to pieces, and then leave you in the night
        And I tried my best to stay by your side
        But who knew the rolling seasons would reveal that sometimes
        We aren't meant to be the one?
        So, goodbye to the ones we once loved
        I realized it wasn't anyone's fault at all
        It's just that I wasn't built to build you up when you fall
        Maybe we were meant to be a lesson to each other
        But I wish you well, and I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
        Oh, I apologize for coming into your life
        Just to break your heart to pieces, and then leave you in the night
        And I tried my best to stay by your side
        But who knew the rolling seasons would reveal that sometimes
        We aren't meant to be the one?
        So, goodbye to the ones, I wasn't meant to be the one
        So, goodbye to the one I once lovedSaw you singing your song the other day
        It's been a long time since your eyes lit up that way
        I felt the guilt build up as I looked back how things went wrong
        Did I have to sweep in and scar you?
        Five years, we shared the bittersweetness of our youth
        Then we broke up, because sometimes it is the best thing to do
        Did it ever cross your mind that maybe you hurt me too?
        But I'm not taking it against you
        Since the beginning, I never wanted anything
        But to see you reach your dreams, I knew that you just wanted me
        But I had dreams of my own, and I just couldn't let them go
        So, I apologize for coming into your life
        Just to break your heart to pieces, and then leave you in the night
        And I tried my best to stay by your side
        But who knew the rolling seasons would reveal that sometimes
        Since the beginning, I never wanted anything
        But to see you reach your dreams, I knew that you just wanted me
        But I had dreams of my own, and I just couldn't let them go
